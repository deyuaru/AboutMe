    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Edmund.
    \n\nI love fish.
    \n\nThe kind that is fresh-caught and swims around on a plate.
    \nFun fact is that I have several farms.
    \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
    \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing, nope.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Nowhere, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon that never existed with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
